                <ul><li>Joan Didion cemented herself as icon of the culture and as one of America's most renown writers of the 20th century. With her wide-range of works — from fictions to non-fictions, political journalism to screenplay-writing —, Didion left a mark on the world making use of her greatly thought-out  way of writing, carefully crafting the structure of her sentences to convey exactly what she wanted to say. And as a writer who knew the importance of each and every sentence, Joan Didion always laid out her reality on the page exactly as she saw it through her eyes. </li></ul>

                          "There was no fog on the sightline of Didion. When she analyzed the absurdities of American politics, she identified and accurately described the racism, corporate restraints, self-serving myths and lack of ambition that paralyze the political system, rendering it unable to adequately address the needs and concerns of the electorate."

                        <h4>Slouching Towards Bethlehem</h4>
                        <p>[Didion] wrote from her own personal perspective; adding her own feelings and memories to situations, inventing details and quotes to make the stories more vivid, and using many metaphors in order for the reader to get a better understanding of the disorder present in the subjects of her essays, whether they be politicians, artists, or American society itself.</p>

With the publication of The White Album, Didion had established herself as a prominent writer on Californian culture.</p>
